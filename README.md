# Arduino Fish Feeders
This was a project for Honors Science Research I, Spring 2015.

At Century High School, Science teachers are required to spend time, even during summer, feeding the fish in the Aquaculture lab. One of the course requirements for students in H Science Research I is to complete a "Main Project", which involves an experiment that is long enough to take several weeks. My instructor encouraged me to build fish feeders, simply because he, and the rest of the science department, was tired of spending time on something as mundane as feeding fish.

What I have included is an arduino library specifically designed to encapsulate my fish feeder design: It involved a large hopper (a milk jug), two servos, and a dixie cup. One servo would open into the cup, and the other would drop food below, maintaining a roughly consistent output (1 cup's worth) of food per feeding. Commentary written within the sketch and associated files explains the exact features in much greater detail.

If you are another student in this class, I encourage you to continue my work. One problem I could not fix was the physical consistency of the "Floating Food." The feeders I built could handle "Sinking Food", but given the wet sand-like consistency of the "Floating Food", the device would not drop a consistent amount of food. This issue may be better dealt with through mechanical additions then altering the software, but this is for you to decide.
